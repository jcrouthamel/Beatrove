## üêç Python Helper Scripts

Beatrove includes two Python utility scripts to help prepare your music collection for optimal use with the application.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Backup Your Music Collection**
> Before using these scripts, especially `music_file_fixer.py`, **always create a complete backup of your music files**. The filename fixing script will rename your audio files, and while it includes safety checks, it's essential to have a backup in case you need to revert changes. Consider using a backup tool or simply copying your music directory to a safe location before proceeding.

### üìù generate_music_list.py

Automatically scans your music directory and generates a properly formatted `tracklist.csv` file.

**Features:**
- Scans directories recursively for audio files (MP3, FLAC, WAV, AIFF, AAC)
- Extracts metadata from ID3 tags and file names
- Supports custom metadata fields (Energy Level, Record Label)
- Handles both standardized and non-standardized filenames
- Outputs in CSV or text format
- Validates BPM and musical key formats

**Requirements:**
```bash
pip install tinytag mutagen
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Basic usage - scan directory and create text file
python generate_music_list.py /path/to/music/directory

# Output as CSV format
python generate_music_list.py /path/to/music/directory --csv -o tracklist.csv

# Custom output location
python generate_music_list.py /path/to/music/directory -o my_tracklist.txt
```

**Expected Filename Format:**
The script works best with files named: `Artist - Title - Key - BPM.extension`
Example: `Deadmau5 - Strobe - 8A - 126.flac`

### üîß music_file_fixer.py

Standardizes your music filenames to match the format expected by Beatrove and the generator script.

**Features:**
- Analyzes existing filenames and identifies formatting issues
- Suggests standardized renames following the `Artist - Title - Key - BPM.ext` format
- Dry-run mode to preview changes before applying
- Extracts BPM and key information from filenames
- Uses metadata as fallback for missing information
- Preserves complex track titles with multiple parts

**Requirements:**
```bash
pip install tinytag
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Dry run - see what would be renamed (default)
python music_file_fixer.py /path/to/music/directory

# Apply renames with confirmation
python music_file_fixer.py /path/to/music/directory --apply

# Apply all renames without confirmation
python music_file_fixer.py /path/to/music/directory --apply --auto-yes

# Use custom defaults for missing BPM/key
python music_file_fixer.py /path/to/music/directory --default-key 1A --default-bpm 128
```

**Workflow Example:**
1. Use `music_file_fixer.py` to standardize your audio filenames
2. Run `generate_music_list.py` to create a comprehensive tracklist
3. Copy the generated `tracklist.csv` to your Beatrove directory
4. Open Beatrove and enjoy organized track management

### üîÑ Recommended Workflow

For best results with Beatrove, follow this preparation workflow:

1. **Organize Your Files**: Ensure your music files contain proper ID3 metadata
2. **Fix Filenames**: Run `music_file_fixer.py` to standardize naming
3. **Generate Tracklist**: Use `generate_music_list.py` to create your data file
4. **Load in Beatrove**: Place the generated file as `tracklist.csv` for auto-loading
