## üêç Python Helper Scripts

Beatrove includes two Python utility scripts to help prepare your music collection for optimal use with the application.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Backup Your Music Collection**
> Before using these scripts, especially `music_file_fixer.py`, **always create a complete backup of your music files**. The filename fixing script will rename your audio files, and while it includes safety checks, it's essential to have a backup in case you need to revert changes. Consider using a backup tool or simply copying your music directory to a safe location before proceeding.

### üìù generate_music_list.py

Automatically scans your music directory and generates a properly formatted `tracklist.csv` file with professional metadata extraction.

**Features:**
- Scans directories recursively for audio files (MP3, FLAC, WAV, AIFF, AAC)
- Extracts metadata from ID3 tags and file names
- Supports custom metadata fields (Energy Level, Record Label)
- **üé® Cover Art Extraction**: Extracts album artwork from MP3/FLAC files
- Handles both standardized and non-standardized filenames
- Outputs in professional CSV or legacy text format
- Validates BPM and musical key formats
- Progress reporting and detailed error handling

**Requirements:**
```bash
pip install tinytag mutagen
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Get comprehensive help and examples
python generate_music_list.py --help

# Basic usage - scan directory and create text file
python generate_music_list.py /path/to/music/directory

# Professional CSV output with cover art extraction
python generate_music_list.py /path/to/music/directory --csv --extract-artwork -o tracklist.csv

# Extract artwork to custom directory
python generate_music_list.py /path/to/music/directory --csv --extract-artwork --artwork-dir ./covers

# Custom output location
python generate_music_list.py /path/to/music/directory -o my_tracklist.txt
```

**Cover Art Extraction:**
- Supports MP3 (ID3 tags) and FLAC (embedded pictures)
- Automatically detects JPEG/PNG formats
- Creates organized artwork directory with clean filenames
- Adds artwork paths to CSV output for future integration

**Expected Filename Format:**
The script works best with files named: `Artist - Title - Key - BPM.extension`
Example: `Deadmau5 - Strobe - 8A - 126.flac`

### üîß music_file_fixer.py

Standardizes your music filenames to match the format expected by Beatrove and the generator script.

**Features:**
- Analyzes existing filenames and identifies formatting issues
- Suggests standardized renames following the `Artist - Title - Key - BPM.ext` format
- Dry-run mode to preview changes before applying
- Extracts BPM and key information from filenames
- Uses metadata as fallback for missing information
- Preserves complex track titles with multiple parts

**Requirements:**
```bash
pip install tinytag
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Get comprehensive help and examples
python music_file_fixer.py --help

# Dry run - see what would be renamed (default)
python music_file_fixer.py /path/to/music/directory

# Apply renames with confirmation
python music_file_fixer.py /path/to/music/directory --apply

# Apply all renames without confirmation
python music_file_fixer.py /path/to/music/directory --apply --auto-yes

# Use custom defaults for missing BPM/key
python music_file_fixer.py /path/to/music/directory --default-key 1A --default-bpm 128
```

**Professional Workflow:**
1. **Backup** your music collection (essential!)
2. Use `music_file_fixer.py --help` to understand filename standardization
3. Standardize filenames: `music_file_fixer.py /path/to/music --apply`
4. Generate comprehensive tracklist: `generate_music_list.py /path/to/music --csv --extract-artwork`
5. Copy generated `tracklist.csv` to your Beatrove directory
6. Enjoy organized track management with cover art support

### üîÑ Recommended Workflow

For best results with Beatrove, follow this preparation workflow:

1. **Organize Your Files**: Ensure your music files contain proper ID3 metadata
2. **Fix Filenames**: Run `music_file_fixer.py` to standardize naming

```

**CSV Column Details**:
- **Artist**: Artist or DJ name
- **Title**: Track title (including remix info, features)
- **Key**: Musical key in Camelot notation (5A, 12B)
- **BPM**: Beats per minute (numeric only)

- **Path**: Full absolute path to audio file
- **Genre**: Musical genre
- **Energy**: Energy level format "Energy 7" (1-10 scale)
- **Label**: Record label name
- **Artwork**: Cover art path (optional)

#### **Legacy Format** (Still Supported)
Dash-separated format for backward compatibility:
```
Artist - Title - Key - BPM.extension - Duration - Year - Path - Genre - Energy # - Label
```

**Automatic Detection**: Beatrove automatically detects which format your file uses and parses accordingly.

### Audio Preview Setup
1. Click any preview button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)
2. Select your audio files folder when prompted
3. Audio files will be matched by filename
4. Enjoy previewing your tracks with the visualizer

### üé® Cover Art Setup

#### **Directory Structure**
```
Your-Music-Folder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Artist - Title - Key - BPM.flac
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Artist - Title - Key - BPM.mp3
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ artwork/                    ‚Üê Cover art directory
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Artist - Title.jpg      ‚Üê Simplified naming (new)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Artist - Title.jpeg
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Artist - Title.png
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Artist - Title.webp
```

#### **Supported Image Formats**
- **.jpg** (JPEG) - Recommended for smaller file sizes
- **.jpeg** (JPEG)
- **.png** (Portable Network Graphics)
- **.webp** (WebP)

#### **File Naming Convention**
Cover art files use a simplified **Artist - Title** format:

**Audio File:** `Deadmau5 - Strobe - 8A - 126.flac`
**Cover Art:** `artwork/Deadmau5 - Strobe.jpg`

*Note: Legacy full filename format (`Artist - Title - Key - BPM.jpg`) is still supported for backward compatibility.*

#### **How It Works**
1. **Automatic Detection**: When you select an audio folder, Beatrove looks for an `artwork` subdirectory
2. **Smart Matching**: For each track, searches for cover art in priority order (jpg ‚Üí jpeg ‚Üí png ‚Üí webp)
3. **Fallback**: Shows clean SVG placeholder when no cover art is found
4. **Toggle Control**: Use the üé® Cover Art button to show/hide artwork

#### **Using the Python Script**
Extract cover art automatically from your audio files:

```bash
# Extract cover art to default 'artwork' directory
python generate_music_list.py /path/to/music --extract-artwork

# Extract to custom directory
python generate_music_list.py /path/to/music --extract-artwork --artwork-dir ./album_covers
```

**Extraction Features:**
- Supports MP3 (ID3 tags) and FLAC (embedded pictures)
- Automatically detects JPEG/PNG formats
- Creates organized artwork directory with clean filenames
- Adds artwork paths to CSV output

## üß™ Testing

Beatrove includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability and quality.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Install dependencies first
npm install

# Run all tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (reruns on changes)
npm run test:watch

## üìù Data Format Notes

The application expects tracklist data in a specific format. The format supports multiple entry types:

- **Basic**: `artist - title - key - BPM.ext - time - year`
- **With Genre**: `artist - title - key - BPM.ext - time - year - genre`
- **With Path**: `artist - title - key - BPM.ext - time - year - path - genre`
- **With Energy**: `artist - title - key - BPM.ext - time - year - path - genre - Energy #`
- **Full Format**: `artist - title - key - BPM.ext - time - year - path - genre - Energy # - Record Label`

The parser intelligently detects file paths, genre tags, energy levels, and record labels in flexible positions.
